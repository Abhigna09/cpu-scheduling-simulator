# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A console-based CPU Scheduling Simulator implemented in C, demonstrating core Operating System scheduling algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF) – Non-preemptive
- Priority Scheduling – Non-preemptive
- Round Robin Scheduling

## Features
- User can choose the scheduling algorithm
- Dynamic input for:
  - Number of processes
  - Arrival time
  - Burst time
  - Priority (for Priority Scheduling)
  - Time quantum (for Round Robin)
- Displays:
  - Waiting Time (WT)
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)
  - Average WT and TAT
  - Execution order of processes

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Online C Compiler / GCC

## Sample Output
Screenshots of execution for each algorithm are available in the `screenshots` folder.

## How to Run
1. Copy the code into any C compiler (GCC or online compiler)
2. Compile and run the program
3. Select the desired scheduling algorithm
4. Enter process details when prompted

## Learning Outcomes
- Strong understanding of CPU scheduling concepts
- Practical implementation of OS algorithms
- Improved logic building and debugging skills
